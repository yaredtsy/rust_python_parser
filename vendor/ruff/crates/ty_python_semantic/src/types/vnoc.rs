//! `pub` wrappers around otherwise-private `ty_python_semantic` accessors,
//! for `pylspt` (`crates/pylspt`) — the entire reason this crate is forked
//! rather than pulled from crates.io/git.
//!
//! Lives under `types` (not a sibling of it) because Rust privacy is
//! module-scoped: `crate::types::{ClassBase, ClassLiteral, ClassType}` are
//! only re-exported `pub(crate)` from `types.rs` (`types.rs:118`), so a
//! wrapper declared outside `types` could not even *name* them to call
//! `ClassLiteral::iter_mro`/`Type::member`, let alone call them.
//!
//! Rules for anything added here, because a fork without them is
//! unmaintainable:
//!
//! 1. One `pub fn` per accessor `pylspt` actually needs — add on demand, not
//!    speculatively.
//! 2. One internal call each. No logic, no reimplemented semantics — that is
//!    the entire point of forking instead of hand-rolling MRO/descriptors/
//!    `__getattr__` a second time, where a second copy would disagree with
//!    ty wherever ty is right.
//! 3. Only genuinely PUBLIC types in a wrapper's signature — `Type<'db>`,
//!    `&dyn Db`, `&ProgramEnvironment<'db>`, plain Rust types. Never
//!    `ClassLiteral`/`ClassBase`/`ClassType` themselves: `pylspt` could not
//!    write that type name even if the wrapper were `pub`, for the reason
//!    above.
//! 4. A rebase only ever conflicts on this file plus the one `pub mod vnoc;`
//!    line in `types.rs` — keep it that way.
//!
//! `pylspt` owns one test per wrapper (not here): the compiler catches a
//! signature change on rebase, only a test catches a *behaviour* change.

/// `ClassLiteral::iter_mro` (`class.rs:644`) is `pub(crate)` and yields the
/// class first (`MroIterator::next`, `mro.rs:691-699`) — `.skip(1)` drops it,
/// matching Jedi's `py__mro__()[1:]` and the wire shape's `base_classes`.

/// Uses `to_class_type`, not `let Type::ClassLiteral(c) = ty`: `Type` has two
/// class-ish variants, `ClassLiteral` and `GenericAlias` (`Box[int]`), and

/// specialised generic.

/// `None` holds a base's *position* when ty cannot tie it to a `Definition`
/// (`Any`, `Unknown`, `Protocol`, `Generic`) rather than dropping it — a
/// dropped slot would shift every base after it. What a `None` slot should
/// render as in `base_classes` is `pylspt::mro`'s decision, not this one's.

/// Supersedes `pylspt::mro::base_classes`'s hand-rolled C3 over the public,
